Dasith
-----------------------------------------------
Basically checks spellings and gives suggestions if the word is not found on the list.

I rewrote the whole programme and it's much faster ........ and now has suggestions.....

The word.lst now has over 32,000 words ........ 

And a special thanks goes out to Peter(baddest_attitude@hotmail.com) who helped me with the speed factor.

The word list is not included .... Please download the word list at  http://gedara.freeyellow.com/as/Spell_check.zip


What's New since version 1.0
-----------------------------------
1. 100x faster spell checking. (2000 words in 0.5 Sec on a P4 1.6 GHz)
2. 100x or more faster suggestions. ( Now has 3 filter levels.)
3. No repetition of words. (So just feel free to add words to the words.lst when you find a list of words.)
